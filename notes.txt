1) npm init -y  
    this creates an empty nodejs project
    and creates package.json to contain the configurations of our project

    Q-> difference between package-lock and package.json
    Q-> what is the use of package.json
    Q-> how can you write custom dev and build scripts for your server

    Environments -> 
            Development Env -> we can log things, debugging, error handling
                                our API keys, secret tokens, connection URIs are accessible 
            E-Commerce API -> Secret Keys, connection strings, salt key  
            
            Build Env -> Only functionality and features are used
            we dont need WHOLE NODE_MODULES, onl those features that are being used, are imported into our projects

2) written custom scripts 
3) Integrating express.js for routing
        -> install express.js  -> npm install express
        -> import express in our endpoint file -> const express = require('express');
        -> we create an instance of express->  const app = express();


        EXPRESS.JS -> javascript package, that is used for building backend projects    
                        -> Routing 
                        -> Methods - defines the purpose of our api calls 
                            GET     - fetch something from the server
                            POST    - send something to the server and to the database
                            PUT     - sending small 
                            DELETE  - deletes
                            PATCH   - updates
                        -> amazon.com/products
                            -> if we want to fetch the list of products     - GET
                            -> add some products to the database            - POST
                            -> delete the products                          - DELETE



4) we define routes
    app.method("path", (req, res)=>{
        handling logic for that request
        req-> extracts data sent from the client
        res-> sends the data to the client
    })

5) we add the port listener
    app.listen(port_number, ()=>{
        console.log("Server is up on the port_number")
    })














Javascript is an object based language 

data, array, string, object, functions 

function name(input){

    logic
}

name(input)


()=>{

}
