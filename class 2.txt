Routing
Handlers
Treat the client request as objects
Response as objects as well

Middleware 
    -built in -> parsing json, extracting query parameters, error handling
    - custom -> logging ->  monitoring 

Middleware is a function that is ALWAYS called before any route is handled 
    - Protected Data -> Authentication ->JWT
    - Logging

    app.use((req, res, next)=>{
    const time = new Date().getTime();
    console.log("Time: ", time, "Method: ", req.method, "Path: ", req.path);
    next();
    })


    - Parsing json files
        app.use(express.json());
    -for urlencoding  built in middlewares 
        app.use(urlencoded({extended:true}));
